- **Warning Yellow**: #FF9800 (delayed launches)
- **Error Red**: #f44336 (completed/failed launches)
- **Background**: Cosmic gradient from #0a0a2e to #16213e to #0f3460

## API Integration

### Launch Library API
- **Endpoint**: https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/upcoming/
- **Parameters**: `?limit=20&offset=0`
- **Filtering**: Client-side filter for Florida locations:
  - Cape Canaveral, FL, USA
  - Kennedy Space Center, FL, USA
  - Locations containing "Florida" or "FL"

### Data Structure
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  name: string (mission name),
  net: string (launch date ISO format),
  rocket: { configuration: { name: string } },
  pad: { 
    name: string,
    location: {
      name: string,
      country_code: string
    }
  },
  status: { name: string },
  mission: { description: string }
}
```

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Client-Side API Filtering
**Decision**: Filter launches on client-side rather than server-side  
**Reason**: Launch Library API doesn't support location filtering in query parameters  
**Implementation**: Filter by pad location name containing Florida/FL keywords  

### 2. Mock Data Fallback
**Decision**: Provide comprehensive mock data as API fallback  
**Reason**: Ensures app functionality even if API is unavailable  
**Implementation**: Realistic Cape Canaveral launch data with proper formatting  

### 3. Exact Color Matching
**Decision**: Extract exact hex colors from logo for brand consistency  
**Reason**: Professional appearance requires precise color coordination  
**Implementation**: #0E182A dark blue for all information blocks  

### 4. Real-Time Countdown Updates
**Decision**: Update countdown timers every second  
**Reason**: Provides engaging, live experience for users  
**Implementation**: useEffect with 1-second interval, proper cleanup  

### 5. Expandable Information Architecture
**Decision**: Show essential info by default, expand for details  
**Reason**: Clean layout with access to full mission descriptions  
**Implementation**: Click-to-expand cards with smooth CSS transitions  

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
- **Efficient Re-renders**: Proper useEffect dependencies to prevent unnecessary API calls
