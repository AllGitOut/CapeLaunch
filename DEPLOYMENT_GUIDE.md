# CapeLaunch Deployment Guide - Share Your App with the World! 🚀

## 🌍 Hosting Options Overview

CapeLaunch is a **static single-page application** built with React + Vite, which makes it perfect for modern hosting platforms. No server required!

## ⚠️ **Important: Microsoft Enterprise Managed User (EMU) Restrictions**

**If you're using a Microsoft work/corporate account, you may encounter:**
- 🚫 **Azure Static Web Apps:** Limited permissions to create Resource Groups
- 🚫 **GitHub Pages:** "Pages on Enterprise Managed User repositories are disabled"
- 🚫 **GitHub Actions:** May have restricted permissions

**✅ Solutions for Microsoft EMU accounts:**
- **Use Netlify or Vercel** with your **personal email** (not work email)
- **Manual deployment** to hosting platforms
- **Local build + manual upload** to hosting services
- **Request admin permissions** from your IT department (if for work purposes)

### **🏗️ Step 2: Create Static Web App Resource (3 minutes)**

1. **In Azure Portal, click "Create a resource"** (big + button)
2. **Search for "Static Web Apps"** in the marketplace
3. **Click "Static Web Apps"** → **"Create"**

4. **Fill out the creation form:**
   ```
   Subscription: [Microsoft Employee Options:]
   ├── "Microsoft Azure Sponsorship" ← RECOMMENDED for MS employees
   ├── "Visual Studio Enterprise Subscription" (if you have one)
   ├── "Microsoft Azure Internal Consumption" (internal projects)
   ├── "Pay-As-You-Go" (if available)
   └── Any other Microsoft employee subscription you see
   
   💡 Note: Microsoft employees typically see different subscription 
   options than general public. Choose any available - Static Web Apps 
   free tier applies to ALL subscription types!
   
   Resource group: 
   ⚠️  MICROSOFT EMPLOYEE FIX: If "Create new" fails with permissions error:
   ├── Click dropdown and SELECT AN EXISTING resource group
   ├── Look for: "Default-Web-[Region]", "rg-[something]", or similar
   ├── Choose any existing RG - your Static Web App will be isolated within it
   └── This is normal for corporate subscriptions with restricted permissions!
   Static Web App details:
   └── Name: "capelaunch-dashboard" (this becomes part of your URL)
   └── Plan type: "Free"
   └── Azure Functions and staging details:
       └── Region: Choose closest to you (e.g., "East US")
   ```

5. **Click "Sign in with GitHub"** button
   - **Authorize Azure Static Web Apps** to access your GitHub
   - This allows Azure to read your repositories

---

### **🔗 Step 3: Connect Your Repository (2 minutes)**

6. **GitHub repository settings:**
   ```
   Organization: [Your GitHub username - algarces_microsoft]
   Repository: "prompt-to-prototype-challenge"
   Branch: "main"
   ```

7. **Build configuration (IMPORTANT):**
   ```
   Build Presets: "React" (this auto-fills the fields below)
   App location: "/" (root of your repository)
   Api location: "" (leave empty - we don't have backend APIs)
   Output location: "dist" (where Vite puts the built files)
   ```

8. **Click "Review + create"**
9. **Click "Create"** (Azure starts setting everything up)

---

### **⚡ Step 4: Automatic Setup Magic (3 minutes)**

**Azure automatically does this for you:**
1. **Creates a GitHub Actions workflow** file in your repository
2. **Sets up build and deployment pipeline**
3. **Configures global CDN**
4. **Generates your live URL**

**You'll see:** "Deployment in progress..." in the Azure portal

---

### **🌐 Step 5: Get Your Live URL**

10. **After deployment completes (~3 minutes):**
    - **Click "Go to resource"** in Azure portal
    - **Your live URL** will be displayed: 
      `https://capelaunch-dashboard-[random-string].azurestaticapps.net`
    - **Click the URL** to see your live CapeLaunch app! 🚀

---

### **🔄 Step 6: Automatic Updates Setup**

**From now on, every time you push to GitHub:**
```bash
# Make changes to your code
git add .
git commit -m "Add new features"
git push origin main

# Azure automatically:
# 1. Detects the push
# 2. Runs npm run build
# 3. Deploys new version
# 4. Updates your live site (usually takes 2-3 minutes)
```

---

### **📝 Step 7: Verify Everything Works**

**Test these on your live site:**
- ✅ **CapeLaunch loads** and shows rocket launches
- ✅ **Countdown timers work** and update in real-time
- ✅ **Responsive design** works on mobile (test with phone)
- ✅ **API calls succeed** (Florida launches load from Launch Library)
- ✅ **Logo displays** correctly
- ✅ **All styling** appears as expected

---

### **🎯 Troubleshooting Common Issues**

**If you get "You do not have permissions to create resource groups":**
```
⚠️  Microsoft EMU Account Detected!

Solution: Use an existing Resource Group instead:
1. Click Resource Group dropdown (don't click "Create new")
2. Select any existing RG from the list
3. Your Static Web App will be isolated within it
4. This is normal for corporate subscriptions
```

**If GitHub authorization fails:**
```
⚠️  Corporate GitHub restrictions may block Azure integration

Alternative: Deploy to Netlify or Vercel instead
- These platforms work with EMU accounts
- Use your personal email for signup
- Connect via GitHub OAuth (usually works)
```

**If build fails:**
```yaml
# Check the GitHub Actions workflow file created in:
# .github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-[name].yml

# Make sure these settings are correct:
app_location: "/"
api_location: ""
output_location: "dist"
```

**If site loads but looks broken:**
```bash
# Check that your local build works first:
npm run build
npm run preview

# If local preview works but Azure doesn't, check:
# 1. Case-sensitive file paths (Azure is Linux-based)
# 2. Asset paths in your code
# 3. Build logs in Azure portal
```

**If API calls fail:**
```javascript
// Make sure your API calls use HTTPS (not HTTP)
// Launch Library API should work fine:
const API_URL = 'https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/upcoming/';
```

---

### **🔧 Azure Portal Management**

**After deployment, you can:**

1. **View deployment logs:**
   - Go to your Static Web App resource
   - Click **"GitHub Actions"** to see build history

2. **Monitor performance:**
   - Click **"Overview"** for traffic stats
   - Click **"Metrics"** for detailed analytics

3. **Set up custom domain (optional):**
   - Click **"Custom domains"**
   - Add your domain and follow DNS instructions
   - Azure provides free SSL automatically

4. **Environment variables (if needed later):**
   - Click **"Configuration"**
   - Add any environment variables for your app

## 🔧 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### **Before You Deploy:**
- [ ] **Test locally:** `npm run dev` works perfectly
- [ ] **Build succeeds:** `npm run build` completes without errors
- [ ] **Preview build:** `npm run preview` shows working app
- [ ] **Check responsive design** on mobile
- [ ] **Verify API calls** work in production build
- [ ] **Test countdown timers** are accurate
